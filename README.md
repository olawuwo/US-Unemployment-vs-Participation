# US-Unemployment-vs-Participation

This is a brief Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore the relationship between unemployment and labor force participation in the US. Unemployment refers to the percentage of people who are actively seeking employment but are currently without a job. Labor force participation refers to the percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment.

The dataset was sourced and retrieved from [Fred](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) using an API, prepared, and wrangled the data using Pandas. The graphs were plotted using Matplotlib and Plotly Express. Please feel free to review the notebook here or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tolawuwo/unemployment-vs-participation-using-fred/notebook), explore the dataset further if you can, and let me know your thoughts or questions. Thanks.
